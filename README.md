# Full-Screen agile board mode for Jira

This extension improves the readability of the agile boards of Atlassian Jira.
Works perfectly with both the Scrum and the Kanban boards.

ðŸ“º Excellent for wall mounted devices
With the current JIRA options it is impossible to have a full-screen board taking advantage of all the real estate on your wall mounted device.
Simply press the expand button (blue button) that is added to your board, press F11, and voila, full-screen goodness.

ðŸ’¡ Combine with other extensions
- Use with Dark Reader to get a Dark mode on you Jira board.
- Use with Revolver to show more than 1 Jira board on the same device.
