# Full-Screen agile board mode for Jira

> Forked from https://github.com/rui-costa/jira_fullscreen_board

> I did some quick and dirty rewrite so that it works with the current Jira version (December 2022)

> The code needs some more cleanup and polishing, but it should be good to work with.

This extension improves the readability of the agile boards of Atlassian Jira.
Works perfectly with both the Scrum and the Kanban boards.

ðŸ“º Excellent for wall mounted devices
With the current JIRA options it is impossible to have a full-screen board taking advantage of all the real estate on your wall mounted device.
Simply press the expand button (blue button) that is added to your board, press F11, and voila, full-screen goodness.
